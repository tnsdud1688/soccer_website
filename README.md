# soccer_website

This website is about the leceister city which is in Premium league.
I have 5 html, 1 java script, and 1 css.
5 htmls are classfied with History, Main page, Locateion, Starters, and Video.
They have format for the entire website, also they have individual page script in the html files.

my webpage includes images, videos, button lists up, maps, comments line, move to the other website directly,
and searching lists.

Those are mostly basic skills for the htmls and javascript, however, I have experience with making with
my own website, I think this can give lots of effects to my future skills.
I have confidence with making website.
